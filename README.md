# Try_To_Hack_My_Cipher
***This is a program that encrypts and decrypts with a map and allows you not to be exposed to frequency and salt attacks.***
***Tries to break the encryption assuming it doesn't know the given map and vector***

# How does it work
***this rust program encrypts and decrypts using symmetric encryption using a keymap.***

***The text must be a maximum of 256 characters long for the algorithm to remain secure.***

## We publish the project as a challenge and welcome feedback on vulnerabilities at: u.calice@studenti.poliba.it

***because for this implementation we have not used any known encryption algorithm and there are no mathematical rules to regulate its operation***
